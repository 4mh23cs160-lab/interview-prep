## 📌 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on GAN

---

### 1. **What is a GAN?**

A **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** is a deep learning model that generates new data similar to real data using **two neural networks**:

* **Generator**
* **Discriminator**

They compete with each other in a game-theoretic setup.

---

### 2. **Who introduced GANs and when?**

GANs were introduced by **Ian Goodfellow** and his team in **2014**.

---

### 3. **What are the main components of a GAN?**

* **Generator (G):** Creates fake data
* **Discriminator (D):** Distinguishes real data from fake data
* **Adversarial loss:** Measures how well G fools D

---

### 4. **How does a GAN work?**

1. Generator creates fake samples
2. Discriminator classifies real vs fake
3. Generator improves to fool Discriminator
4. Discriminator improves to detect fake
5. Training continues until generated data looks realistic

---

### 5. **What is the objective function of GAN?**

GANs use a **minimax loss function**:

[
\min_G \max_D V(D,G)
]

The Generator minimizes the loss while the Discriminator maximizes it.

---

### 6. **What is the role of the Generator?**

The Generator:

* Takes random noise or input data
* Produces fake samples
* Learns to generate realistic outputs

---

### 7. **What is the role of the Discriminator?**

The Discriminator:

* Acts as a binary classifier
* Outputs probability of real or fake
* Guides the Generator through feedback

---

### 8. **What is Conditional GAN (cGAN)?**

A **Conditional GAN** generates data **based on a condition**, such as:

* Class label
* Image
* Text

Example: Image-to-Image translation (Pix2Pix).

---

### 9. **What is Pix2Pix GAN?**

Pix2Pix is a **conditional GAN** used for **image-to-image translation**, where:

* Input image → Output image
* Uses **U-Net Generator**
* Uses **PatchGAN Discriminator**

---

### 10. **What are common applications of GANs?**

* Image generation
* Image-to-image translation
* Super-resolution
* Face synthesis
* Style transfer
* Data augmentation
* Medical imaging

---

### 11. **What is Mode Collapse?**

Mode collapse occurs when:

* Generator produces **limited varieties**
* Different inputs result in similar outputs

This is a common GAN training problem.

---

### 12. **Why are GANs difficult to train?**

* Unstable training
* Mode collapse
* Sensitive to hyperparameters
* No clear convergence metric

---

### 13. **What is PatchGAN?**

PatchGAN:

* Classifies **small image patches**
* Improves texture quality
* Commonly used in image-to-image GANs

---

### 14. **What loss functions are used in GANs?**

* Binary Cross Entropy (BCE)
* Least Squares Loss (LSGAN)
* Wasserstein Loss (WGAN)

---

### 15. **What is WGAN?**

**Wasserstein GAN** improves training stability by:

* Using Earth-Mover distance
* Removing sigmoid activation
* Adding gradient penalty

---

### 16. **Difference between GAN and Autoencoder?**

| GAN                  | Autoencoder          |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Adversarial training | Reconstruction-based |
| Generates new data   | Compresses data      |
| Hard to train        | Easy to train        |

---

### 17. **GAN vs Diffusion Models**

| GAN            | Diffusion                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Fast inference | Slower but better quality |
| Needs training | Often pretrained          |
| Can collapse   | Very stable               |

---

### 18. **What datasets are used for GANs?**

* MNIST
* CIFAR-10
* CelebA
* Cityscapes
* Custom image datasets

---

### 19. **What are real-world GAN examples?**

* Deepfake generation
* FaceApp
* NVIDIA StyleGAN
* Image enhancement tools

---

### 20. **Why are GANs important in GenAI?**

GANs:

* Laid the foundation for generative AI
* Inspired modern models
* Enable realistic synthetic data generation
